#Kaitlyn notes
# mesa.Agent seems to be an built in functionality of mesa used to establish agents. In this example, agents are created
# first by ascribing how they move with RandomWalker, then wolf and sheep inherit the attributes of an agent and 
# walking pattern from random walker so the sub class tree goes mesa.Agent -> RandomWalker -> wolf/sheep, and that's why
# the grass just inherits mesa.Agent because it doesn't need to move

# #If we wanted to implement movement towards watering holes
# # little worried about the reel life application - what is our justification for doing this mathmatically?
