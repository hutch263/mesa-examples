    "Species reintroduction is one method that researchers use to restore historic population metrics in an ecosystem. Population dynamics are an important insight into any predator reintroduction project and serve as metrics for conservation management protocols. However, these methods of sampling are often limited by the stochasticity of the natural ecosystem and mammal behavior. In this study, we considered how the reintroduction of the Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) would affect the trophic structure of the grass and Elk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni) and potentially introduce a trophic cascade using agent based modeling. We initially attempted to create a predator-prey dynamics agent based model using classes, class inheritance, object oriented programming, control-flow and boolean statements. After this, we implemented the MESA modeling library, which is “an open-source Python library for agent-based modeling, ideal for simulating complex systems and exploring emergent behaviors” (Kazil et al., 2020).  We modified the original MESA wolf-sheep example to suit the scope of this project, specifically the agent.py, random_walk.py, model.py and server.py files. Ecological conditions were altered by changing the abiotic and biotic factors of the environment and agent behavior to further represent the community of Yellowstone National Park. We changed the environmental conditions of the model, such as the seasonality and availability of food and water energy. We also changed the initial population parameters and reproduction rate to best characterize the actual wolf and elk populations. To further simulate true conditions, we changed the random movement and energy loss of wolves and elk of Yellowstone. Analysis of the agent based model and agent behavior showed that the population dynamics of each trophic level were altered by the introduction of wolves into our simulated Yellowstone model. The addition of this top predator induced changes in the relative elk population and reciprocal changes in the amounts of the grass present, which is consistent with the literature. The subsequent graphing of the population metrics also suggested that basic Lotka-Volterra principles were at play with the balancing of the wolf and elk species over multiple timesteps. Results from this project are consistent with that the reintroduction of the top predator, the Gray Wolf, caused a trophic cascade which affected the subsequent prey and producer populations. This project has the potential to inform conservation management and protocols as a viable tool in projecting potential outcomes of predator reintroduction projects. There are areas for further research in agent based modeling to benefit conservation, which include the need to expand the model and sampling for abiotic conditions, ecosystem processes and functions, landscape fragmentation and connectivity, and global change factors.  \n"
